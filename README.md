# DDP1-Solutions

DDP1 (Dasar-Dasar Pemrograman 1/Programming Foundations 1) is a subject in Universitas Indonesia's Computer Science major in which the students are taught the basics and foundations of programming. Although the subject mainly explains the materials in Python language, the materials taught are to be generally applied in all programming languages.

This repository is created to keep my solutions of quizzes and labs, all in Python language.
